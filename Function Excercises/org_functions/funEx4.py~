# palindrome program

# this program will ask the user to enter a word and it will determine whether it is a palindrome or not 

# make the function is_palindrome
def is_palindrome(word):
# make string filled in to get it backwards 
    backward = ""
    word = word.lower()
    for char in word:
        backward = char + backward
# if the word is equal to the word backwards it's a palindrome
    if word == backward:
        answer = word+" is a palindrome"
# if it's not the same it's not a palindrome
    else:
        answer = word+" is not a palindrome"
    return answer
# ask them for the word
word = raw_input("enter the word you are checking: ")
# give them the answer
print is_palindrome(word)

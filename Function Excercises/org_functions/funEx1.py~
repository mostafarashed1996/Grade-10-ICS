# hypotenuse of right angled triangle
# last update Dec 20
# this program will ask the user for the 2 side lengths of a right angled triangle and find the hypotenuse

# make hypotenuse function using pythagorean theorem
def hypotenuse(side1, side2):
    side3=(side1**2+side2**2)**0.5
    print side3
# ask them for the side lengths
side1 = input("what is your 1st side's lenght?")
side2 = input("what is your seccond side's length?")
# output answers
print "your hypotenuse is equal to"
hypotenuse(side1, side2)

# pay program

# ask them for the amount of hours the worked
hours = input("how many hours did you work this week?")
# ask the user their hourly pay rate
payRate = input("what is your hourly pay rate?")
# make net pay function 
def netPay(payRate,hours):
# make a total 
    total = payRate*hours
# subtract the tax and union fee to get left over 
    left_over = total - (total*0.21) - (total*0.02)
    print "your left over money is eual to ",left_over
# multiply the total by 0.02 ot get union fee
    union_fee = total*0.02
    print "your union fee is", union_fee
# multiply the total by 0.20 to get tax
    tax = total*0.20
    print "your tax fee is", tax
print netPay(payRate,hours)

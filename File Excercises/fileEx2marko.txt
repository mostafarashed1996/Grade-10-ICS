#Opening and Editing Multiple Files
#Marko Alhamadani
#Last revised: April 10, 2012
#This program will open 2 files simultaneously in write and read formats respectfully. It will then generate random marks for the given names, and then input them into a new file. Finally, it will read the new file, printing out the average mark.

#Import random function to allow for random generation of numbers.
from random import randint
#Open 2 files 
classnames = open("ICS2_Class.txt","r")
classmarks = open("Classmarks.txt","w")
#Set up accumulators for total marks and number of marks.
marknum = 0
marktotal = 0
#Prints out the required headers for the list.
print "\tInitials      Grade"
print "\t--------      -----"
classmarks2=open("Classmarks.txt","a")
#Set up loop to read and write the names of the students also generate random marks 
while True:
    #Read each line of the text file.
    name = classnames.readline()
    #if no name was read then break the loop
    if name == "":
        break
    #Set variable for initials, and assign to string variable
    Initials = name[0].upper()
    while name.count(" ")>0:
        Initials = Initials + name[name.find(" ")+1].upper()
        name = name[:name.find(" ")]+name[name.find(" ")+1:]
    #generate random marks for each student.
    Mark = randint(50,100)
    #Print the initials and the marks of the students
    print "\t   " + Initials + "\t\t " + str(Mark)
    var=classmarks2.write("\t   " + Initials + "\t\t " + str(Mark)+"\n")
    #Add one to the 'marknum' variable and add mark to the 'marktotal' variable
    marknum+=1
    marktotal+=Mark
#Prints average
average=round(marktotal*1.0/marknum,1)
print "\t\t      -----"
print "\t Average%11.1f" % (average)+"%"

#User can check if a word is in the dictionary. If the word is not the dictionary then the user may add it 

#Open's dictionary as read 
#Creates a variable for the list, keepGoing and the line 
#Creates a while loop to read each line
#Creates a while loop to continue asking the user for words
#If the word is in the dictionary, print yes it is.
#Else, print that the word is not in the dictionary but it will be added
